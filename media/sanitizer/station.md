- 3-9 ft vinyl tubing
    - length depends on barrel used
    - length depends on conduit used
    - ID should match primer bulb barbs

- pvc conduit, elbows, barbs as needed
    - depends on barrel used
- plywood, plank scrap, 2x4, 2x2, etc. lumber
- 6 ft rebar x2
- door hinge
- soap dispenser
- zip ties
- duct tape
- strapping
- conduit bracket x2

- chain or cable as needed, lock

## Construction

Drill holes in plywood base for rebar, zipties, tubing toes. Screw lumber to base to support barrel and protect pump. Screw plank and hinge to base. Attach pump to base with zipties.

Drill barrel for chain or cable. Drill barrel lid for input conduit. Screw lumber shelf to barrel lid. Build spigot from conduit and barb. Attach spigot to shelf with brackets and/or zipties.

Place barrel on base. Hammer rebar into earth through base. Ziptie rebar to shelf. Strap rebar to barrel.

Build input conduit, easiest is a length of conduit sawed with a 45 degree end, long enough that it can't fall in the barrel when placed in the hole.

Attach tubing to pump. Ziptie tubing to rebar so that toes protect tubing on base. Attach outlet tubing to spigot. Place input conduit in hole. Thread tubing in input conduit until it nearly reaches bottom of barrel.

Ziptie and duct tape soap dispenser to rebar.

Prime pump by pouring water down output tubing until pump can be actuated.

Thread chain or cable through holes. Lock to stationary object.

## Notes

Based on https://www.instructables.com/id/Camp-Sink-Temporary-Hand-Washing-Station/

Better if barrel can be strapped to a post, alter base to accept post in that case. Better if barrel can be remote from pump and spigot or inaccessible, alter base in that case to support pump and spigot.

Better to replace input conduit with weight at end of input tubing.

Design is intended to be cheap, annoying to steal or strip, easy to service and replace, easy to source. A trap at the top will make the first pumping easier. No graywater basin for ease of cleaning, this means that the spigot has to be inconveniently located to keep water away from pumper's foot. This is not our best deployed design but it's cheaper (if barrels are available) and easier, and I don't know enough to describe the fancy one.
